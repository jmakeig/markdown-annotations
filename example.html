For example, he might designate an `SSN` property of a person to be personally identifiable (PII), according to a regulation. Because he has already declared how to apply security and redaction policy to all PII data in a particular context, his `SSN` data is automatically secured. He can look up which data is PII and show over time who has had access.

We need help these teams not only to properly implement MarkLogic, but how MarkLogic fits into a modern and proven development workflow. This includes testing, configuration management, source control, security best practices, deployment and continuous integration, etc. Our products and methodologies will reinforce these best practices.</td></tr>
